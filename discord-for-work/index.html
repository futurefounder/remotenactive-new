<p>If not, you will learn something interesting in the next minutes.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get things going.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-discord">What is Discord?<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#what-is-discord"></a></h2><p>Discord is a communication tool mainly used by gamers that allows people to voice chat, share photos and videos, and join channels with their friends.</p>

<p>Discord is a great tool for remote leaders like you as well, because it allows them to communicate with your team members quickly and easily.</p>
<p>These are some of the features you can use on discord</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chat platform</strong> - This will be used by everyone in your organization. You will use it for communication, collaboration, and shared problem-solving among other tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Voice communication</strong> - Just talk your team via voice communication, it can be more effective than typing out messages all day long. Plus, video conferencing is just one click away!</li>
<li><strong>Video conferencing</strong> - This will allow people who are not co-located to connect with each other virtually.</li>
</ol>
<p>As Discord is created for gamers, you might want to ask:</p>
<h2 id="is-discord-safe-for-business">Is Discord safe for business?<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#is-discord-safe-for-business"></a></h2><p>With over 300 million users, Discord is one of the fastest-growing social platforms on the web.</p>
<p>As mentioned, it&rsquo;s also one of the most popular tools for gamers, but it&rsquo;s not just for them.</p>
<p>Here are some reasons why you can can use discord as a remote leader in a company and do not have to worry about safety.</p>
<p>üîí <strong>Private Chats</strong> ‚Äî Private chats allow you to communicate directly with another user without broadcasting your conversation publicly across a server channel. This allows for more personal conversations between co-workers, which makes it an ideal solution for virtual teams who need to collaborate on projects remotely (or even in the same office).</p>
<p>üöß <strong>Channel Moderation</strong> ‚Äî Discord is also safe for businesses because it offers moderation tools (I will show you some in a minute) that allow you to block trolls or users who violate your terms of service or community guidelines.</p>
<p>You next question will certainly be:</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-discord-for-work">How to use Discord for work<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#how-to-use-discord-for-work"></a></h2><p>Now you might be wondering how you can actually use Discord.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions</p>
<h3 id="team-collaboration">Team collaboration.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#team-collaboration"></a></h3><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Ru2aZREJacrDzWqvdt" width="480" height="360" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/drinkdroplet-teamwork-productivity-captain-planet-Ru2aZREJacrDzWqvdt">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Discord helps you create separate channels for different projects or departments so that everyone can join in easily.</p>
<p>You can create separate channels for different teams like sales team, marketing team, support team etc., and assign them their own channels so that they can collaborate with each other easily.</p>
<h3 id="customer-service-platform">Customer service platform.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#customer-service-platform"></a></h3><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/5UyNFT88LPINM1Lzyl" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/expopass-happy-reaction-smile-yes-excited-cool-reactions-mrw-work-yeah-nice-good-5UyNFT88LPINM1Lzyl">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>You can also use Discord as an online customer service platform where customers can get in touch with your support staff or customer service representatives directly through voice calls or text messages.</p>
<p>This way they don‚Äôt need to wait on hold or wait until someone picks up their call on a phone number which may take several minutes or hours depending upon how busy your support staff is at that time.</p>
<h3 id="file--link-sharing">File &amp; link sharing<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#file--link-sharing"></a></h3><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/CTX0ivSQbI78A" width="480" height="355" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/internet-computer-technology-CTX0ivSQbI78A">via GIPHY</a></p>
<p>Another business use case for Discord is as a way to share files and links quickly with other people in your company.</p>
<p>If you want to automate tasks, you can let a Discord Bot take over the work for you.</p>
<p>Here are some</p>
<h2 id="discord-bots-for-work-you-should-know">Discord Bots For Work You Should Know<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#discord-bots-for-work-you-should-know"></a></h2><p>Discord Bots are a great way to enhance your Discord server. They can do everything from adding custom commands and automating tedious tasks to playing games with you.</p>
<p>There are two types of bots:</p>
<p>ü§ñ <strong>Direct</strong>: These work on their own and don&rsquo;t require any interaction from the user. They can be used as tools, such as the weather bot, but they also have more complex uses like auto-moderation or managing music queues.</p>
