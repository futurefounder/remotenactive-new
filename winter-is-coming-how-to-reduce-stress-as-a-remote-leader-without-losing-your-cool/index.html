<h2 id="the-challenges-of-remote-work">The challenges of Remote Work<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#the-challenges-of-remote-work"></a></h2><p>In fact, most people don&rsquo;t realize this until they try to work remotely and then suddenly feel burned out.</p>
<p>As a solution, some remote workers plan their days down to the minute in order to make sure that they get everything done.</p>
<p>This leads them to feel like a hamster on a wheel, constantly running but never going anywhere.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder why so many remote employees end up feeling stressed and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s important to be proactive about stress reduction ‚Äî which is why you are here, high five!</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;ll be sharing my top tips for remote leaders who want to reduce stress while working remotely.</p>
<p>As a leader, <a href="https://www.remotenactive.com/what-is-remote-leadership/" target="_blank">you have the power to inspire your team</a> by showing them what calm and peaceful leadership looks like.</p>
<p>Lead yourself with competence so that your team can see how great it feels to learn from an experienced practitioner.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are some simple things you can do in order to reduce stress when working remotely without having to plan too much ahead of time.</p>
<p><strong>How to reduce stress in 6 easy steps</strong></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.‚Äù <strong>- James Clear in Atomic Habit</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Give yourself a time-frame for when you need to be done with work</strong></p>
<p>Working remote is all about finding the balance between work and life.</p>
<p>But, if you&rsquo;re like me, then it feels like there&rsquo;s never an end to what needs doing.<br>
There are always more emails to answer or tasks left undone before I can call my day done!</p>
<p>It can be hard to know when exactly &rsquo;the point&rsquo; should come.</p>
<p>One of the most effective solutions is to set an imaginative ‚Äúpress conference‚Äù deadline. Until when <em>exactly</em> does something have to be ready?</p>
<p>Set a date and time and stick to it, as if you are holding a press conference. Then you will truly understand, what ‚Äúdone is better than perfect‚Äù means.</p>
<p><strong>2. Set goals for the day and break them down into manageable chunks</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a new day, and you have a lot going on.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to get overwhelmed, so an easy to implement solution is to break your tasks into achievable chunks!</p>
<p>In the book ‚Äú<a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a>‚Äú the author James Clear dives into deep details on how to create a system of becoming better every day.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U_nzqnXWvSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>One main aspect is to create small, easy to handle tasks, that can be done within the day.</p>
<p>The idea is that when we make these goals achievable, they become more motivating.</p>
<p><strong>3. Find an online tool or app that lets you keep track of your progress</strong></p>
<p>Keeping track of your goals and progress can be difficult.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get distracted or lose momentum when you don&rsquo;t have a strategy in place.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are many tools and apps available that will help keep you on track!<br>
One app that may work for you is <a href="https://habitica.com/?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">Habitica</a>, which gamifies productivity by turning habits into quests.</p>
<p>You set up your own list of tasks (e.g., ‚Äúpraise teammates,‚Äù ‚Äúgo for a walk once a day‚Äù) and then receive rewards when you complete them (e.g., gold coins, health potions).</p>
<p>The game element makes it fun to stay motivated, the time-tracking feature helps with accountability, and the chat forums connect people who share similar goals, so they can support each other through their journeys.</p>
<p>In case you want to keep it simple, you can just use this <a href="https://www.remotenactive.com/60bb4401179745288da937ee44c2e8d0" target="_blank">official notion Template</a>, that let&rsquo;s you track your progress in a simple, yet powerful way.</p>
<p><strong>4. Take breaks every hour ‚Äî five minutes is better than nothing!</strong></p>
<p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2021/10/grafik-2.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/brain-research?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">research is in, taking breaks every hour</a> will help you become more productive and reduce stress.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about how long the break is, it&rsquo;s about making sure to take a break at all!</p>
<p>The average human can only handle so much before becoming mentally exhausted.</p>
<p>That means that working for eight hours straight without any kind of break could be counterproductive and may lead to poor performance or even mental health issues.</p>
<p><strong>5. ¬†Do something else during those breaks, like reading a book or going for a walk</strong></p>
<p>As a Remote Leader, you are always on.</p>
<p>You work long hours, hop from one meeting to the next, and never stop moving. It&rsquo;s no surprise that you need a break, as I just mentioned.</p>
<p>You have to actively seek out things to have nothing to do with your job. Take a walk without looking at your cellphone (leave it at home!), or read a fiction book, that does not discuss how companies can increase their ROIs.</p>
<p>Take your focus away from work-related topics, so you can really unwind the mind.</p>
<p><strong>6. ¬†Get up from your desk and stretch at least once an hour</strong></p>
<p>Staying in one place for long periods of time is not good for your body and can lead to back pain and many other inconveniences.</p>
<p>To combat this, try to get up from your desk at least once an hour and stretch or walk around.</p>
<p>Trust me, you&rsquo;ll feel better and be more productive as a result!</p>
<h2 id="2-reminders-for-stress-reduction-while-working-remotely">2 Reminders for stress reduction while working remotely<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-reminders-for-stress-reduction-while-working-remotely"></a></h2><p>Create boundaries between work and personal life by setting up an office space in a different room of the house if possible</p>
<ol>
<li>Give yourself permission to take breaks during the day, even if they&rsquo;re just 10 minutes long. It&rsquo;s totally ok not to be at the Desk the whole day!</li>
<li>Take care of your body by drinking water, eating healthy food, and getting enough sleep. Yes, I know it sounds basic, but these are the things that are often overseen</li>
</ol>
<p>As a leader, it&rsquo;s your job to show your team that remote work can be rewarding and satisfying.</p>
<p>If you feel like all the pressure is getting too much for you, take some time off or talk out how you&rsquo;re feeling with someone close to you.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to let this stress negatively affect not only yourself, but also those who depend on you in order for them to do their jobs well!</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways that leaders have found balance while working remotely, so there‚Äôs no reason why any one person should go without support.</p>
