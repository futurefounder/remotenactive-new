        <p>Finding a remote job can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.
The good news?
You don’t need to know where the needle is to find it!
All you have to do is know what you&rsquo;re looking for and how to search for it.
To help you out, I&rsquo;ve put together this handy guide on how best to find remote jobs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get right into it.</p>
<h2 id="know-what-youre-looking-for">Know what you&rsquo;re looking for<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#know-what-youre-looking-for"></a></h2><p>If you are new to the remote work world, it’s likely that you have a lot of questions about what this type of employment is like. You may be wondering if it&rsquo;s right for your personality, or if there will be enough opportunities available in your field.</p>
<p>It’s important to set some boundaries before starting your search so that you don&rsquo;t waste time applying to jobs that aren&rsquo;t going to work well with your skills and interests.</p>
<p>There are 10 things I recommend thinking through before starting a job hunt:</p>
<h2 id="1-use-your-network">1. Use your network<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#1-use-your-network"></a></h2><p>You&rsquo;ve heard it before, but let&rsquo;s be clear:</p>
<p>💡<strong>Your network is your number one resource for finding remote jobs.</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve worked hard to build relationships with people who know you and understand what you want, so don&rsquo;t be shy about using them to help you find a job.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for remote work, the best place to start is by asking your current employer if they have any opportunities available in the same field or related fields. If they say no or nothing comes up immediately, ask if they&rsquo;d consider maybe starting of with a couple of days of remote work per week.</p>
<p>You should then overdeliver on your remote work days and show your employer how productive you are before asking for some more days.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t pan out, contact alumni associations from past schools and see if anyone knows of any places that would be willing to hire someone like yourself—someone who&rsquo;s been there before!</p>
<p>Finally, reach out directly through LinkedIn connections: Ask them if they know anyone who works remotely or has done so in the past three months, see where those leads take you.</p>
<h2 id="2-scan-the-job-market">2. Scan the job market<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#2-scan-the-job-market"></a></h2><p>The first step to finding a remote job is to research the types of jobs that are available. You can do this by searching for remote jobs on the Internet.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of websites you can check:</p>

<h2 id="3-set-a-goal-and-a-timeline-for-your-job-search">3. Set a goal and a timeline for your job search<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-set-a-goal-and-a-timeline-for-your-job-search"></a></h2><p>This is the most important step in your job search, and it&rsquo;s one that a lot of people get wrong.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a remote job, there are two things you&rsquo;ll have to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define what kind of work you want to do next—and be realistic about your skills and experience level;</li>
<li>Determine how much time it will take YOU (not someone else) to find that job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, the job search is time-consuming and you can not plan everything.</p>
<p>But try and map out a timeline for yourself so that you know</p>
<h2 id="4-be-realistic-about-what-a-remote-job-will-look-like">4. Be realistic about what a remote job will look like<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#4-be-realistic-about-what-a-remote-job-will-look-like"></a></h2><p>Before looking for a remote job, it&rsquo;s important to be realistic about what such a position will look like. Remote work has several advantages, but it also comes with some downsides that you should consider before making the jump.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flexibility—You can set your own schedule and work from anywhere in the world! If you live in an area that doesn&rsquo;t have excellent public transportation, or if you don&rsquo;t like being stuck in traffic on your way to work every day (like me), then this is one of the biggest perks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost savings—No commuting costs mean extra money in your pocket each month! You could use those savings for travel or leisure activities—and who doesn&rsquo;t want that?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-consider-freelance-versus-full-time-work">5. Consider freelance versus full-time work<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#5-consider-freelance-versus-full-time-work"></a></h2><p>If you’re looking for a remote job, you might not be sure what roles are available or how to go about applying for them. There are two major ways that people can work remotely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full-time and</li>
<li>Freelance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pros and cons of each vary widely, so it’s important to weigh the options carefully before deciding which one will work best for your needs.</p>
<p>Pros of freelance work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility.</strong> You can set your own schedule and pick up extra gigs as needed (or not).</li>
<li><strong>Independence.</strong> No boss means no micromanagement!</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Unlimited&rdquo; income.</strong> There is no roof as to how much you can earn, as you set the rates, or if you create a business out of your freelance work you can multiply the money that comes towards you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons of freelance work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security issues</strong> as you do not have a fixed income</li>
<li><strong>Payment variance</strong> - some clients pay freelancers on time, others don&rsquo;t, or sometimes they forget or don&rsquo;t have enough funds in their account. Be mindful of this and always have a reserve in your account.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of benefits</strong> - Although some employers offer bonuses like health insurance plans or paid time off packages, most freelancers have none of these benefits unless they choose add-ons themselves before signing up with a special service</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-prepare-for-video-interviews-and-virtual-meetings">6. Prepare for video interviews and virtual meetings<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#6-prepare-for-video-interviews-and-virtual-meetings"></a></h2><p>To make the process go smoothly, here are a few things you can do in advance.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a webcam, try setting up your room before the interview. Make sure nothing is distracting in the background: no unmade beds and dirty bags flying around.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have a webcam, be sure to not have too much background noise and be at a place where you can speak loud and clear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-dress-the-part-even-if-youre-interviewing-from-home">7. Dress the part (even if you&rsquo;re interviewing from home)<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#7-dress-the-part-even-if-youre-interviewing-from-home"></a></h2><p>When you&rsquo;re interviewing for a remote job, it can be tricky to know what to wear. Though it&rsquo;s tempting to assume your interviewer will be focused on your skills and experience, don&rsquo;t forget that looks still matter—and they may even be more important than ever before.</p>
<p>If the position you&rsquo;re interviewing for is in an office setting, then feel free to wear whatever you would normally wear if you were going into an office: a suit or dress shirt with slacks or khakis.</p>
<p>For most other positions (such as freelance work), I recommend wearing business casual attire: pants/skirt with a button-down shirt or polo shirt and blazer (for men) or dress pants/skirt and blouse/blazer (for women).</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just so that they can see how professional you are; it&rsquo;s also so that no one mistakes what kind of job this is from their perspective!</p>
<h2 id="8-be-prepared-to-interview-at-odd-hours-or-on-short-notice">8. Be prepared to interview at odd hours or on short notice<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#8-be-prepared-to-interview-at-odd-hours-or-on-short-notice"></a></h2><p>The more interviews you do, the more likely it is that you&rsquo;ll come to a point where you&rsquo;ll be asked to interview at odd hours. Employers may want to talk with you about your job history and goals over coffee before deciding whether or not to bring you in for an in-person meeting.</p>
<p>They may also want to get a feel for who you are and what makes you tick by chatting with you on Skype or Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>Usually, they will try and find a time that works in your time zone, but If you are applying to a fully remote company, that does not operate in specific time zones things might get tricky.</p>
<h2 id="9-practice-and-practice-and-practice-interviewing-over-skype-and-google-hangouts-with-a-friend-or-family-member">9. Practice (and practice and practice) interviewing over Skype and Google Hangouts with a friend or family member<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#9-practice-and-practice-and-practice-interviewing-over-skype-and-google-hangouts-with-a-friend-or-family-member"></a></h2><p>No one is born perfect. And certainly, no one came on the planet to ace all remote job interviews from day one. So try and get as much practice as you can.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the setup has to be as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>An easy first option is to practice on your own. Set up a camera so you can record yourself doing the interview. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at how much more confident and clear your answers are when you can see yourself as well as hear your voice!</p>
<p>Next, you can schedule an interview with a friend or family member and also send them the questions you have been preparing for.</p>
<h2 id="10-do-research-using-glassdoor-linkedin-indeed-facebook-groups-twitter-and-even-reddit">10. Do research using Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, Facebook groups, Twitter, and even Reddit<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#10-do-research-using-glassdoor-linkedin-indeed-facebook-groups-twitter-and-even-reddit"></a></h2><p>You might also want to check out Glassdoor, which is a great resource for finding reviews on companies.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is another good place to look for remote jobs since many recruiters use it as a platform for posting their openings.</p>
<p>Facebook groups can be an even better resource than either of these platforms if you can find one that&rsquo;s local or related to your industry. There are groups on Facebook devoted exclusively to finding work in different cities/states/countries/etc., so do some digging and see if there&rsquo;s anything worthwhile in your area!</p>
<p>Twitter also has plenty of people posting about remote jobs—and because Twitter is also used by many professionals, many posts will come from relevant sources like recruiters or individuals that might be hiring.</p>
<p>Reddit can also be a great place to search for remote positions, check these subreddits:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/" target="_blank">r/remotework</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/workfromhome/" target="_blank">r/workfromhome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkOnline/" target="_blank">r/workonline</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="knowing-how-to-find-remote-jobs-can-help-prepare-you-for-tomorrows-workforce">Knowing how to find remote jobs can help prepare you for tomorrow’s workforce<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#knowing-how-to-find-remote-jobs-can-help-prepare-you-for-tomorrows-workforce"></a></h2><p>Remote work is growing, and with it, more remote opportunities are opening up. As a result, there are plenty of companies willing to hire remote workers—not just in tech but also in fields like education and healthcare.</p>
<p>This type of flexibility can be especially beneficial for people who want to stay at home with kids or dogs while they travel the world on their own schedule (the possibilities seem endless!), but it’s also great for those looking for a less stressful commute or people who simply prefer to work from home once in a while.</p>
<h2 id="there-is-a-lot-more-to-finding-remote-jobs-than-just-searching-online">There is a lot more to finding remote jobs than just searching online.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#there-is-a-lot-more-to-finding-remote-jobs-than-just-searching-online"></a></h2><p>You have to be prepared for anything, including working at odd hours and having video interviews.</p>
<p>But this isn’t all bad news: as more companies realize the benefits of remote work, they are creating more opportunities for people who want to work from home or another location where there isn’t an office space available nearby.</p>
<p>With some research and preparation, anyone—even those who live in rural areas with limited access to technology—can find a remote position that fits their lifestyle needs while still providing an opportunity for advancement over time!</p>
<p>I hope you found this guide useful!</p>
