<p>In this article you will learn about a new approach towards strengthening the bond within a remote team.</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous Team Building.</strong></p>
<p>Never heard of it?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>I will start with an explanation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-asynchronous-communication">What is asynchronous communication<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#what-is-asynchronous-communication"></a></h2><p>There are many new definitions that come with the advancements in technology.</p>
<p>Asynchronous communication (short: Async) is one of them.</p>
<p>At its core, asynchronous communication is an exchange of messages between individuals or groups, where some information is delayed until a reply has been received.</p>
<p>The most common forms of asynchronous communications are</p>
<ul>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Instant-, Text-Messages (Chat)</li>
<li>Social Media Posts &amp; Comments</li>
<li>Voice-, Video-Messages</li>
</ul>
<p>Async has become increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Technology-savvy people have become accustomed to working on their own schedule, which can be outside your typical 9-to-5.</p>
<p>Going one step further, experts claim <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90521788/why-im-betting-that-asynchronous-video-meetings-will-be-the-future-of-work?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">Async Video Meetings are the future</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/04/08/the-rise-of-working-from-home?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">the rise of remote work,</a> &ldquo;typical&rdquo; office hours are being challenged, paving the way for unique working schedules.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Async also has drawbacks.</p>
<p>Such as lack of emotional connection and increased risk for miscommunication, which may lead to an increase in conflict due to misunderstanding.</p>
<p>But how does Async connect to team building?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll explain that now.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-async-team-building">What is Async team building<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#what-is-async-team-building"></a></h2><p>Async team building is an excellent, yet often overlooked method for building a cohesive and productive team.</p>
<p>You can create and maintain relationships with your remote team without having to plan a huge event.</p>
<p>This means saving time and money.</p>
<p>Especially if your team is distributed across different time zones, this can be handy.</p>
<p>You just learned about the different types of Async communication, there is also different types of Async team building.</p>
<p>Here are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing trivia via Email</li>
<li>Having a Slack/Teams Channel to post images, or text about personal info</li>
<li>Using a communication bot for weekly check-ins</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-is-async-team-building-is-important">Why is Async team building is important<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#why-is-async-team-building-is-important"></a></h2><p>The internet is buzzing with <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/building-culture/?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">how powerful it is to have a solid team culture</a>.</p>
<p>Many are saying that this can be achieved by having scheduled company events.</p>
<p>While scheduled company events are beneficial, they aren&rsquo;t the only way to build an engaged and connected workforce.</p>
<p>Remote leaders should focus on asynchronous team building as well because it has many benefits that traditional in-person events lack.</p>
<p>First, asynchronous team building brings people together without distractions from work or home life and allows them to bond through shared moments online throughout the week, not just during one event.</p>
<p>Second, you&rsquo;re able to reach more people who live far away from each other and expand your connection across different regions of the country and world, where you would otherwise struggle.</p>
<p>Imagine having Pimchan, a Product Designer from Bangkok and Andrea a Sales Manager from Rome in one team.</p>
<p>When Andrea kicks off his work day at 10 AM after having taken care of his kids, Pimchan is already set up for her afternoon yoga class as it&rsquo;s 4 pm.</p>
<p>Not really convenient.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can help Pimchan and Andrea with Async team building</p>
<ol>
<li>You start a trivia Slack Channel only for the funniest and craziest questions</li>
<li>Pimchan, Andrea and other team members compete against each other</li>
<li>You have a weekly winner on Friday and monthly every last Friday</li>
<li>Monthly winners receive a physical prize like special company gear</li>
<li>The prize is actually sent to the winner</li>
<li>🎉</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
<p>You have bridged the remote and real-life world with Async Team Building!</p>

<h2 id="3-real-examples-of-async-team-building">#3 Real Examples of Async team building<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#3-real-examples-of-async-team-building"></a></h2><p>Now that you have a clear picture of how Async team building works, let&rsquo;s look at some tools and companies that offer special services.</p>
<p><strong>Async Chats</strong></p>
<p>The tool <a href="https://geekbot.com/?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">GeekBot</a> presents stand-up or team bonding questions via Slack/Teams directly to your team members.</p>
<p>For example light-hearted questions about favorite &lsquo;Pizza Toppings&rsquo; reveal fun facts of everyone, while water cooler chats let people build trust and establish a more personal bond in the office space.</p>
<p><strong>Async Trivia</strong></p>
<p>Trivia quizzes are the best way to get everyone on your team talking and learning about each other.</p>
<p>With the help of the tool <a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">Water Cooler Trivia</a> you have it all in one place.</p>
<p>The chance for meaningful conversations is high, because no one can hide what they know when it&rsquo;s their turn in front of the group.</p>
<p>Customized weekly quizzes for teams are available in seconds through this app.</p>
<p>Spark conversations that will maintain positive energy throughout your whole week.</p>
<p><strong>Async Video Messaging</strong></p>
<p>Video messaging is a great way to communicate and collaborate with your team, no matter where they are.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an effective tool that can be used for training sessions, project updates, casual one-on-one chats or even fun and light interactions.</p>
<p>But for some reason, many companies are still hesitant about using video messaging in their remote teams&rsquo; day to day workflows.</p>
<p>But, it does not have to be that way.</p>
<p>The tool <a href="https://www.loom.com/?ref=remotenactive.com" target="_blank">Loom</a> lets you record and send video and screen messages very fast and efficient.</p>
<p>Besides project updates, you can use this to strengthen team bonding.</p>
<p>Instead of spreadsheets, have your team show their favorite website, hobby, and something they are proud of.</p>
<p>It can even be the latest book they have been reading.</p>
