<p>These companies have gone from being just another startup to becoming leaders in the remote first world and thereby transforming the lives of thousands of workers.</p>
<p>Not only are they looking for top notch talent from all over the world, but they have made it a priority to build learning cultures, inclusive cultures and accessible cultures.</p>
<h2 id="want-to-work-from-home-check-out-these-companies">Want to work from home? Check out these companies.<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#want-to-work-from-home-check-out-these-companies"></a></h2><p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of remote work, and you may have even tried it yourself.</p>
<p>But have you ever considered working for a remote-first company?</p>
<p>Remote-first as in no need to be at the office at all.</p>
<p>If so, then this list is right up your alley!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve compiled a list of some of the best remote first companies hiring now.</p>
<p>Remote-first companies are those that offer employees the option to work from home or another location outside the office.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/stages/?ref=remotenactive.com#9-all-remote" target="_blank">remote-first companies do not even have a office.</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not waste any more time and have a look at some remote-first companies that are hiring.</p>
<h2 id="automattic">Automattic<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#automattic"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Automattic is a web development company that is based in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2003 by Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little and currently has about 500 employees.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s largest product is WordPress.org which is the world’s most popular self-hosted blogging tool with more than 60 million websites using this service to host their sites on their servers instead of on third party servers like Google or WordPress.com (the company behind WordPress).</p>
<h2 id="basecamp">Basecamp<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#basecamp"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-1.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Basecamp is a project management tool that helps teams organize their projects and communicate with each other. The company was founded in 2004 by Jason Fried, who is the company&rsquo;s CEO. Basecamp has over 9 million users and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p>The platform offers three main products to customers: Basecamp Classic (free), Basecamp 2 ($99/month), and Campfire ($250/month). The free version of the software allows users to create public projects as well as private ones; it also includes task management tools for small businesses or freelancers to collaborate on projects together via email or phone calls. The paid versions include more advanced features such as issue tracking and file sharing but still lack advanced functionality like multiple roles per user or project access controls</p>
<h2 id="buffer">Buffer<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#buffer"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-2.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Buffer is a social media scheduling and marketing platform that is entirely remote-first. Buffer was founded in 2010 when Joel Gascoigne, Leo Widrich, and Pete Baker decided to build something that would help them better manage their personal blogs and Twitter accounts. They started with a simple tool to schedule posts on Twitter, but over time it grew into a full-fledged marketing platform for all types of businesses.</p>
<p>Today, Buffer has over 300 employees across the globe—all working remotely! We recently talked with Merci Grace about her experience as a new hire at Buffer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt more at home in an office than I do here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My team makes me excited every day.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="doist">Doist<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#doist"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-3.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Doist is also a remote-first company. They state, that they have a strong culture of transparency and collaboration. They also encourage their employees to take time off when they need to recharge or spend more time on other pursuits, so that they can come back to work fully engaged every day.</p>
<p>In addition to these practices, they believe strongly in the importance of remote work: it allows people from around the world—people from all sorts of backgrounds, countries, cultures—to collaborate on projects together without requiring them to move somewhere physically far away from where they live or from where their families are located.</p>
<h2 id="invision">InVision<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#invision"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-4.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>InVision is a design collaboration platform that helps teams create, review and share their ideas. With more than 300,000 users in over 150 countries, InVision’s toolset is the standard for design collaboration.</p>
<p>InVision allows teams from all over the world to work together on their projects without having to be in the same room. They can share mockups with one another, create prototypes, test them out and gather feedback from real users through InVision Boards—and even if you&rsquo;re working remotely from your own office or coffee shop during lunch breaks (hey there!), there&rsquo;s no need to worry about missing out!</p>
<p>The company was founded by two designers who wanted an easier way for teams on different continents to collaborate on projects together; this led them straight into building something they knew would solve this problem: a simple yet powerful digital platform where designers could show off prototypes of their work while collaborating with others inside organizations large enough that they needed several people involved in any given project at once instead of just one person alone looking after everything herself&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="gitlab">GitLab<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#gitlab"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-5.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager with wiki, issue tracking, CI/CD, and more.</p>
<p>It provides all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.</p>
<p>GitLab was founded in 2014 by Sytse Sijbrandij (CEO), Jelmer Schönfeld (CTO), and Dmitriy Zaporozhets (COO). The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
<h2 id="help-scout">Help Scout<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#help-scout"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-6.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Help Scout is a customer support software that helps businesses communicate with their customers.</p>
<p>The company hires remote workers, who primarily work from home offices or co-working spaces.</p>
<p>Help Scout focuses on hiring individuals who are self-motivated and can work independently while still collaborating with their team members.</p>
<h2 id="hubstaff">Hubstaff<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#hubstaff"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-10.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Hubstaff is another a remote first company.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a time tracking software that helps you monitor employee productivity and get better insights into what your employees are doing.</p>
<p>The team is growing fast, so if you&rsquo;re looking for an exciting and fast-paced environment where you can make an impact on the company in its early stages, Hubstaff may be the place for you.</p>
<h2 id="zapier">Zapier<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#zapier"></a></h2><p><figure>
  <a class="paragraph-image">
    <img data-src="https://www.remotenactive.com/content/images/2022/05/image-11.png" data-action="zoom" alt=""  class="lazyload">
  </a>
  
</figure></p>
<p>Zapier is a tool that allows you to connect different apps, so that you can automate tasks. For example, if any new email comes in from your Gmail account, Zapier would automatically send it to Trello.</p>
<p>This kind of automation is what makes Zapier such a great example of a remote first company: their employees can work wherever they want—and often do!</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts<a class="anchorjs-link" href="#concluding-thoughts"></a></h2><p>We&rsquo;re living in a world that is increasingly becoming more global, and the workplace is transforming.</p>
<p>The idea of working from home or another remote location is no longer new and has become part of the culture for many companies.</p>
<p>With remote work on the rise, it&rsquo;s important to stay up-to-date on how we can make this transition successful.</p>
<p>As we continue to navigate these changing times together, I hope you find inspiration in what others are doing well so that you can apply those principles to your own team and company.</p>
